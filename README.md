- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sanfertiago, a 23 years old Economist in love with the capabilities of data.
- 👀 I’m interested in mastering my SQL, Python & R abilities towards Analytics and Data Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for Data Science. I just started one of Kaggle's beginner projects, doing good so far.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Analysis & Data Science projects.
- 📫 Feel free to dm me if you have a Data related project. I'll be pleased to help :)
